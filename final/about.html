        In 2017 our doors open for the first time and we have been going hard ever since. We started this company because we wanted to do our part to combat climate change. By providing our customers with access to tasty sustainable food we hope to help decrease carbon emmissions.

        Meat consumption is not only bad for our planet, it is also bad for our bodies. Eating meat has been linked to several health problems such as high cholesterol, heart disease, and cancer.
